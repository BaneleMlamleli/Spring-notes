1. WHAT IS SPRING?
"Spring" could be:
	Spring Framework
	Spring Boot
	Spring Data
	Spring Cloud
	Spring Batch
	...

Spring Boot can be used for web applications and non-web applications.
Built on top of Spring framework

Notable features:
	Auto configuration
		- automatically configures your application  based on dependencies you have added
		- Setting auto configuration
			@EnableAutoConfiguration
			public class DemoApplication{
				
			}
		- Auto configuration can be easily removed
		
	Standalone
		- It makes it easy to create stand-alone, production grade, spring based applications that you 'just run'
		- Typical process for running Java web application
			Package application -> Choose and download a webserver -> Configure webserver -> Deploy application and start webserver
		- Creating an application that 'just run'
			java -jar MyApplication.jar
			package the application -> Run the application
			
	Opinionated
		- It provides you with typical modules that are generally used
		
Spring framework is a modulor design(components that can be connected together)

Spring framework can be brocken down into six different key areas:
	1. Core
		- This is the foundation of Spring framework
	2. Web
		- Spring web
			- Model View Controller(MVC) result into a more organised and easier to maintain stuff
			- Framework for handling web requests via Spring web MVC or Spring web webflux
				a. Spring web MVC
					Java servlet
						- Low level API
					Spring MVC
						- High level API
				b. Spring web webflux
					- This is another way of handling web requests
					- Request are processed asynchronously
	3. Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP)
		- Increases way of programming that increases organisation of code for concern that span multiple  tier or layers of an application
		@PreAuthorize("hasRole('Admin')")	//annotation are just meta data that's added to the code
		public void sensitiveOperation(){
						
		}
	4. Data access
		- Makes it easier to develop applications that interact with data by removing the biolerplate code
			int cnt = new JdbcTemplate(ds).queryForInt("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo");
		- Data validation support that creates a uniform set of response from different vendor programs (DataIntergrityViolationException)
	5. Intergration
		- Making different application/systems work together
		- Many different ways of exposing operations
			1. Remote method invocation(RMI)
			2. Messaging systems
			3. Web service
	6. Testing
		1. Unit testing
			- Testing small individual parts of the whole application			
		2. Intergration testing
			- Combining all of the individual part and tested as a whole

Exploring other Spring projects
	1. Spring Data Project
		- Spring data project extends Spring Framework's data access support(focus on relational database)
	2. Spring Cloud Project
		- ?
	3. Spring Security Project
		- powerful and highly customisable authentication and access-control framework

Spring a good fit?

CREATING YOUR FIRST SPRING BOOT APPLICATION

Creating Spring Boot project you can use:
	- Spring Spring Tool Suit(Spring STS)
	- Apache Maven
	- IntelliJ

Adding Spring Boot dependencies
	<!-- Adding Spring boot dependencies -->
	<parent>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
		<version>1.3.3 RELEASE</version>
	</parent>

How does Spring Boot work?
	1. Main Java file that will run the App/entry point
	2. Spring Application
		- Spring context
		- Spring environment initializer (autoconfiguration and initializers based on the dependencies and annotation)
	3. Embedded Server container (Tomcat is the default and it is automatically configured)

1. Spring Boot starters
2. Containerless deployments
3. Auto-configurations
4. Testing with Spring Boot

How do you know what each dependency will integrate?
- Read through documentation and research

What is Maven and how does it relate or work with Spring?
- Maven is a build dependency management tool
- Maven bundles the entire project(associated processes including: compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.)

Bill of Materials?
- list of parts, items, assemblies and other materials required to create a product

Spring Initialiser?
- Creates all dependencies and annotations for your project

Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

Wed Jun 20 12:25:06 CAT 2018
There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found, status=404).
No message available

Lesson learnt from the above error message:	The main class should be in the root package.
This is because Spring will only scan the classes below the main class package.
It kind use the top-down concept

@SpringBootApplication annotation. This annotation 'wraps up' many other necessary annotations for the application to work.
One such annotation is @ComponentScan annotation.
This annotation tells spring to look for Spring components and configure the application to run

TESTING THE SPRING BOOT PROJECT

what does a scope do?
What is a container and it's example?

//This dependency will help us to test our Spring Boot project
spring-boot-starter-test
- Spring Test tools
- JUnit framework (http://junit.org)
- Hamcrest (http://hamcrest.org)
- Mockito (http://mockito.org)

//Adding the Spring Test tools dependency
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Scope??

1. What is MAVEN?
	Maven is a built tool
		- It produces one artifact(component)
		- It helps us manage dependencies
		
	Maven can be used as a project management tool
		- It handles releases and versioning
		- Describes what the project is doing or what it produces
		- Can easily produce JavaDocs and other site information

2. Introduction to Maven (Creating a HelloWorld project)
	- Maven file structure
		- src/main/java		//This is the directory for the Java main class
		- pom.xml			// This is the pom file that will contain all the dependencies and project details. POM stands for Project Object Model
	
	- POM File can be divided into four parts
		1. Project information
			a. groupId		- company/package name. usually com.companyname
			b. artifactId	- name of our application
			c. version		- version of the app/project
			d. packaging 	- This is how we want to distribute application (jar, war)
			
		2. Dependencies
			direct dependencies used in our application
		
		3. Build
			a. Plugins
			b. Directory structure
		
		4. Repositories
			a. Maven is the essential repo directory
3. Types
	- pom
	- JAR
	- EAR
	- PAR
	- WAR
	- Maven-plugin
	- ejb

4. Maven repositories
	- Local repositories
		This is installed in your home directory .\m2

5. Plugins
